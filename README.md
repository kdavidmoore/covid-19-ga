# covid-19-ga

## Objective
Retrieve and visualize daily new COVID-19 cases in Georgia

## Details
main.js and main.py are both executables that can be run from a terminal. The difference between the two is that main.js is written in JavaScript (Node.js) and main.py is a Python 3 script. They both produce a CSV file that can be used to visualize daily new COVID-19 cases in Georgia. The R script covid-19.ga.R may be used to load this CSV file and visualize the data within.

## TODO
Make this into a web app.
